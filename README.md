This is my Gallifreyan translating tool.

It is designed to make writing SVGs programmatically easier. It's also completely written in safe rust.

If you don't know rust, but know how to program, you'll probably need a few quick lessons in Rust before this becomes super useful for you. Otherwise, if you insist on heading straight into the crate, I reccomend looking at:

hello_world.rs 

&

test.rs

As examples of how to use this crate.

Enjoy.
